Information about Brake Bias, ABS, and Traction Control will be provided.

If ABS or TC is engaged, the background will blink. Additionally, if there is a change in electronic values, an overlay will display the change.

Information about your last lap will be displayed here. 

The color of the lap is as follows: Purple indicates your best lap for this session, green means you are lapping at your pace time, and yellow indicates that you are slower than expected.

If there is a change in track grip, it will be displayed here for a few seconds.
The values may vary based on the sim.
