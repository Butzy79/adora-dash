## General Main Screen
AdoraDash has three main differences based on the type of session you are conducting. Here, we will delve into the specific screens and information common to all sessions, as well as the unique features of each session.

***PLEASE READ [Action Buttons and Triggers](triggers.md) SECTION to understand how to interact with AdoraDashboard***

### Common screens
- [Electronics Box](#electronics-box)
- [Last Lap Box](#last-lap-box)
- [Functions and Map Box - Clock Time](#functions-and-map-box---clock-time)
- [Pit Box](#pit-box)

#### Electronics Box
![Electronics](/src/images/docs/walkthrough/electronics.jpg)

Information about Brake Bias, ABS, and Traction Control will be provided.

If ABS or TC is engaged, the background will blink. Additionally, if there is a change in electronic values, an overlay will display the change.

#### Last Lap Box
![Last Lap](/src/images/docs/walkthrough/lastlap.jpg)

Information about your last lap will be displayed here. 

The color of the lap is as follows: Purple indicates your best lap for this session, green means you are lapping at your pace time, and yellow indicates that you are slower than expected.

If there is a change in track grip, it will be displayed here for a few seconds.
The values may vary based on the sim.

#### Functions and Map Box - Clock Time
![Functions ana map](/src/images/docs/walkthrough/functions.jpg)

Here, information about the lights, rain lights, wiper speed, and blinker of your car is displayed. Next to it, you will see the engine map value of your car.

By using the touchscreen or Trigger Action B on your controller, you can switch between viewing functions and real clock time.
Assetto Corsa and other simulators display only this screen, as the other screen is not compatible with the simulator.

If a flag is waved on the track, this display will show the corresponding flag.

#### Pit Box
![Pit Box](/src/images/docs/walkthrough/pit.jpg)
Three values are displayed here:

- Mandatory Pit Stops: These are the mandatory pit stops you still need to make.
- MFD Value: If the simulation permits displaying this value, you will see the amount of fuel you need to load for your next pit stop here.

  If the fuel needed for the next pit stop is sufficient to complete the session, a large white number or a dash (if no pit stop is planned) will be displayed.
  If the fuel needed is insufficient or no pit stops are planned but there isn't enough fuel to finish the session, a second number will appear indicating the additional fuel needed to complete the session. The large number in this case will be shown in red.
  ![Fuel Missing](/src/images/docs/walkthrough/pit_missing.jpg)
- Fuel Surplus: This indicates the surplus fuel available to complete the session. If a dash is displayed ("-"), it means you will not have enough fuel to complete the session.
