# ACTION BUTTONS AND TRIGGERS

## General
You can set up your controller to interact with some actions of Adora Plugins Controllers. 
Some of those actions require a valid license for the Adora Plugin. 
To do that, in SimHub, go to the left menu, select Controls and Events. 
Under the Controls section, click on New mapping, and on the left, select your input controller (you can push a button on your controller to directly select it).
n the left list, select the action to set with this control. Choose the input mode as "Short and Long press" or your preferred option.

## Set Actions Button (A and D) and Next Screen
In SimHub, navigate to DashStudio -> Controls and assign triggers to the A and D buttons, and also for the next screen.
If you are using a DDU, please set up those controls in your DDU interface: Devices -> Control (on your selected device).

- **Action A:** Controls the MFD display, allowing you to scroll between different screens such as Tyres, Map, Damages, and others that will be developed in the coming days.
- **Action B:** Scrolls through Functions screen and Real clock time.
- **Action D:** Scrolls through Fuel values.
