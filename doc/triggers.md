# TRIGGERS

## General
You can set up your controller to interact with some actions of Adora Plugins Controllers. Those actions require a valid license for the Adora Plugin. To do that, in SimHub, go to the left menu, select Controls and Events. Under the Controls section, click on New mapping, and on the left, select your input controller (you can push a button on your controller to directly select it). On the left list, select the action to set with this control. Choose the input mode as "Short and Long press" or your preferred option.

## Set Your Target Temperature (Only licensed)
You can set up your controller to interact with the target temperature of your tires. There are two actions: Tyre.Decrement_TargetTemp and Tyre.Increment_TargetTemp. Assign both to your controller to interact during your session with those values.

## Strategy Time
You can increment and decrement the strategy time in minutes. There are two actions: Strategy.Decrement_TimeInMinutes and Strategy.Increment_TimeInMinutes. Assign both to your controller to interact during your session with those values.
