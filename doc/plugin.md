If you enable LFM and enter your LFM ID, once a race you have subscribed to on LFM is approaching, an information pop-up containing all the server information will appear on the dashboard.

To retrieve your LFM ID, connect to the Low Fuel Motorsport website. Click on your user in the top right corner, and then go to the profile page.

In the URL, you will find the ID, which is the number at the end of the URL.

If this is set up correctly, once you launch the dashboard, the next race will pop up on the screen.
